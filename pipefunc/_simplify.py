    This method identifies the PipeFuncs in the execution graph that
    can be combined into a single function. The criterion for combinability
    is that the functions share the same root arguments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph
        The directed graph of the pipeline functions and input arguments.
    all_root_args
        A dictionary where each key is the output name of a function in the
        pipeline, and the value is a tuple of root arguments for that function.
    func
        The function in the pipeline function we are starting
        the search from.
    conservatively_combine
        If True, only combine a function node with its predecessors if all
        of its predecessors have the same root arguments as the function
        node itself. If False, combine a function node with its predecessors
        if any of its predecessors have the same root arguments as the
        function node.

    Returns
    -------
        A dictionary where each key is a PipeFunc that can be
        combined with others. The value associated with each key is a set of
        PipeFuncs that can be combined with the key function.

    Notes
    -----
    This function works by performing a depth-first search through the
    pipeline's execution graph. Starting from the PipeFunc
    corresponding to the `output_name`, it goes through each predecessor in
    the graph (functions that need to be executed before the current one).
    For each predecessor function, it recursively checks if it can be
    combined with others by comparing their root arguments.

    If a function's root arguments are identical to the head function's root
    arguments, it is considered combinable and added to the set of
    combinable functions for the head. If `conservatively_combine=True` and
    all predecessor functions are combinable, the head function and its set
    of combinable functions are added to the `combinable_nodes` dictionary.
    If `conservatively_combine=False` and any predecessor function is
    combinable, the head function and its set of combinable functions are
    added to the `combinable_nodes` dictionary.

    The function 'head' in the nested function `_recurse` represents the
    current function being checked in the execution graph.

    """Reduce the dictionary of combinable nodes to a minimal set.

    The input dictionary `combinable_nodes` indicates which nodes
    (functions in the pipeline) can be combined together. The dictionary
    keys are PipeFunc objects, and the values are sets of
    PipeFunc objects that the key depends on and can be
    combined with. For example,
    if `combinable_nodes = {f6: {f5}, f5: {f1, f4}}`, it means that `f6`
    can be combined with `f5`, and `f5` can be combined with `f1` and `f4`.

    This method simplifies the input dictionary by iteratively checking each
    node in the dictionary to see if it is a dependency of any other nodes.
    If it is, the method replaces that dependency with the node's own
    dependencies and removes the node from the dictionary. For example, if
    `f5` is found to be a dependency of `f6`, then `f5` is replaced by its
    own dependencies `{f1, f4}` in the `f6` entry,  and the `f5` entry is
    removed from the dictionary. This results in a new
    dictionary, `{f6: {f1, f4}}`.

    The aim is to get a dictionary where each node only depends on nodes
    that cannot be further combined. This simplified dictionary is useful for
    constructing a simplified graph of the computation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    combinable_nodes
